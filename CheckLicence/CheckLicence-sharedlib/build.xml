    <!-- The build.properties file can be created by you and is never touched
         by the 'android' tool. This is the place to change some of the
         default property values used by the Ant rules.
         Here are some properties you may want to change/update:

         source.dir
             The name of the source directory. Default is 'src'.
         out.dir
             The name of the output directory. Default is 'bin'.

         Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should
         be updated using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

         This file is an integral part of the build system for your
         application and should be checked into Version Control Systems.

    <!-- Execute the Android Setup task that will setup some properties
         specific to the target, and import the build rules files.

         The rules file is imported from
            <SDK>/tools/ant/
         Depending on the project type it can be either:
         - main_rules.xml
         - lib_rules.xml
         - test_rules.xml

         To customize existing targets, there are two options:
         - Customize only one target:
             - copy/paste the target into this file, *before* the
               <setup> task.
             - customize it to your needs.
         - Customize the whole script.
             - copy/paste the content of the rules files (minus the top node)
               into this file, *after* the <setup> task
             - disable the import of the rules by changing the setup task
               below to <setup import="false" />.
             - customize to your needs.
